Observations from Heroes of Pymoli analysis
Of the 576 total players, 484 of them are males (84.03%) who make the most purchases as well $1,967.64 over the 780 total purchases. Females also make a good portion of players as well at 14.06% spending $361.94 in total. On averge females spend more per purchase and per person. While our data does show that "Other / Non-Disclosed" do have a higher "average purchase price" and "average total purchause per person" this group only makes up 1.91% of our data. Meaning that the averages are going to be nautrally higher.

Of the total player base the ages groups 20-24, 15-19, and 25-29 have the highest numbers of purchases and total purchase value. This is logical since these three age groups make up the majority of the player base at 44.79%, 18.58%, and 13.37% respectively.

The three most profitable game items are "Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm," "Nirvana," and "Fiery Glass Crusader" earning $50.76, $44.10, $41.22 respectively. These three are also some of the popular items in game. As a suggestion, these three items should be promoted more frequently on the in-game store to help increase the sale volumes.
